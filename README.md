# Getting and Cleaning Data Project
This repo is for the coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" course project assignment.
The original data could be downloaded at: 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

The repo includes:
(1) run_analysis.R: the R script that can be run against the original data set to get the tidy data, 
(2) CodeBook.md: a codebook that describes the variables in the tidy data. 

To run the R script run_analysis.R:
Download and extract the data to the Project directory. Then change the name of the folder to "UCI_HAR_Dataset", which should be under the /Project directory. 
Then set the /Project as the working directory and run the script.
The tidy data is named: HAR_tidy_data_set.txt

A codebook is available in the repository and is named CodeBook.md.
